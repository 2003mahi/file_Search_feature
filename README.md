This is a program I've written to solve a small problem I faced. I used to practice C programs that I was taught in my college. I used to save them for revision, with a common name, changing only the number in the name. For example, prog1.c, prog2.c, prog3.c, and so on. I always wrote a small description of the program in a comment.
